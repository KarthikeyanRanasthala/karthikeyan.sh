It's been about 6 months since I got my first job as a developer at [smallcase](https://smallcase.com) and It's time to step up the game a little. Starting from revamping my website, restart blogging, problem solving, opensource contributions and finally stand out to be one of the best (If not, the best ðŸ˜…) in the community. Join me in this journey where I explore everything from 'git' to 'serveless computing'.

## So what changed?

1. New domain name, karthikeyan.space is now [karthikeyan.sh](https://karthikeyan.sh)
2. Switched from Gatsby (Portfolio) + Hugo (Blog) to Next.js
3. Switched from Github Pages to Vercel for hosting

## What to expect?

- Mostly related to web development
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Some random crazy stuff to try if you're familiar with programming (Ever heard [kartOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kartos/), A custom debian based linux distro)

I'll be starting off by sharing how [karthikeyan.sh](https://karthikeyan.sh) is built. Feel free to checkout the code on [Github](https://github.com/KarthikeyanRanasthala/karthikeyan.sh), It's opensource.

Instead of dumping everything in this single post, I'll be writing up seperate posts explaining in detail. I've listed down ðŸ‘‡ a few. Depending on when you're seeing it, the following list can just be a chunk of plain text or links to some clear and high quality content ðŸ˜‰.

1. Getting started with Next.js and Typescript
2. Setting up ESLint and Prettier
3. Setting up Next.js with Tailwind CSS
4. Setting up next-mdx-remote and syntax highlighting
5. And many more.

## Roadmap

- Post new content atleast twice a month
- Find better ways to deliver the content (Maybe newsletters or even push notifications)
- Finally, build a community

I'm open for suggestions or even a casual discussion. Feel free to drop a ðŸ‘‹ to [hello@karthikeyan.sh](mailto:hello@karthikeyan.sh) or catch up on twitter [@_iamkarthikeyan](https://twitter.com/_iamkarthikeyan)
